> The Piano Puzzle appears in Silent Hill, and is the second puzzle to appear in Midwich Elementary School after the Old Man's Hand puzzle. Harry Mason receives the Silver Medallion after successfully completing the piano puzzle.

It's a rather interesting puzzle that the player comes across after a couple of hours of playtime.
